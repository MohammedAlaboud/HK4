# HK4

For this event, two projects were built. 

# 1. Detect

A simple security camera that only records when it detects movement. Built with a Pi and Pi cam. 
 - I could not find the video I took :( 

# 2. Game

A flappy-bird-like game displayed on an LCD screen and controller using a touch sensor. Built with a Qualcomm DragonBoard and some additional generic hardware.
